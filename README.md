## VueJs Contact List

#### [Demo](https://vue-contacts-demo.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple contact list app as a learning project, built with [vue](https://vuejs.org/), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), express, mongoDB and [bulma](http://bulma.io/) css framework. 

A simple API serves contact data from a cloud-hosted mongoDB database on [mLab](https://mlab.com/), which are generated from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)

You can check out [demo app](https://vue-contacts-demo.herokuapp.com/) on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). (Dyno probably sleeping, might take a while for initial load.)

### TODO:

- [x] Deploy a demo application
- [x] Switch to mongodb instead of parsing local JSON
- [ ] Add create, update, delete contact functionality
- [ ] Unit tests
