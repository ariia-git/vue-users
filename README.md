## VueJs Contact List

#### [Demo](https://vue-contacts-demo.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple contact list app as a learning project, built with [vue](https://vuejs.org/), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [bulma](http://bulma.io/) css framework. 

A simple API (built with Express) serves user data from a local JSON file, which are generated from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)

You can check out [demo app](https://vue-contacts-demo.herokuapp.com/) on heroku or run it locally by cloning or downloading this repo.
``` 
npm install

npm start
```
