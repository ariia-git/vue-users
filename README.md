## VueJs Contact List

This is a simple contact list app as a learning project, built with [vue](https://vuejs.org/), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [bulma](http://bulma.io/) css framework. 

A simple API (built with Express) serves user data from a local JSON file.

To run it locally clone or download this repo and run
``` 
npm install

npm start
```

### TODO:

- [ ] Deploy a demo application to Heroku
- [ ] Switch to mongodb
- [ ] Add create, update, delete contact functionality
